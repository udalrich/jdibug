Location based breakpoints:

connect-to-vm
		  set bp in vm
		  		if fail, set bp in inner classes (*NOT DONE*)
		  			if fail, create prepare event for class and inner classes

class-prepare
		  set bp in vm

enable-breakpoint
		  find class
		  		 if fail, create prepare event for class and inner classes
		  set bp in vm
		  		if fail, set bp in inner classes
					if fail, create prepare event for class and inner classes


What if the breakpoint is set in a static inner class that is already
prepared, but the outer class is not loaded?  I think this is just a
fail.  Or we could use semantic to figure out the name of the class at
that line.
