* JDIbug News                  -*- outline -*-

* 0.5 (Current)

** Added jdibug-remove-all-breakpoints
Removes all breakpoints with one interactive command.

** Large arrays are displayed in segments
Displaying all the entries of a large array (1000+ entries) is slow, and it is rare that the user will want to
look at every entry, so much of the time spent retrieving the entries is wasted.  If you are looking for entry
18374 in a 938432 element array, it can also take a long time just to find the appropriate entry.

With the current version, if the size of the array exceeds jdibug-locals-max-array-size, expanding the array
shows subarrays, which can be expanded.  While it might take 3 or 4 clicks to find the entry, those clicks
respond much more quickly so the process should be much faster, even with the extra actions.

** Added support for Android and other JVM that only implement JDWP -with-generic commands.
The debug interface defines methods that do not include generic
information (required for pre-1.5 JVM) and methods that do include
generic information.  The latter are now used if available.  Thanks to
Lei Wang for the patch.

** Added breakpoints for when an exception is thrown
`jdibug-break-on-exception' will set a breakpoint for when the given
exception is thrown.  The name must be fully qualified, but it can be
a superclass of the actual exception thrown.  For example,
java.lang.RuntimeException would break if a NullPointerException was
thown.

The method asks about whether caught or uncaught exceptions should
cause a break.  However, as described in the JDWP documentation, it is
possible for either type of exception to be reported as the other type.


* 0.4 (2010-12-05)

** Added simple function to start a program and attach a debugger.
See `jdibug-run'.

** Added expression watchpoints.
The *JDIbug-Watchpoints* window now displays expressions.  Current
support is moderate:
***  Multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
***  Logical and, or
***  Numerical comparisons (<,>,<=,>=,==,!=)
***  Array element access
***  Constant numbers
***  Field access via dot notation (a.b.c)
***  Method calls (foo.bar(baz)) (only tested for no-arg methods)
More should be added soon.

** Added conditional breakpoints.
Any valid expression for a watchpoint that evaluates to a boolean can
be added as condition to breakpoint.  The check on a boolean value is
made at runtime.  To add a conditional breakpoint, create a breakpoint
normally.  Select it in the breakpoints buffer and type "c".

** Added support for breakpoints in inner classes.
In previous version, breakpoints in inner classes where ignored.  They
now work in both anonymous and named inner classes.

* 0.3 (2010-04-28)

** Supports multi dimensional array
Now supports displaying/expanding of multi dimensional array.

** Supports generics
Now the locals browser supports displaying generics as
ArrayList<String>. I do not understand why Eclipse is displaying it
as ArrayList<E>!

** Supports connecting to multiple debuggee
Now JDIbug can connect to multiple debuggee on different host:port.
The configuration parameter jdibug-connect-host and jdibug-connect-port
have been merged into a jdibug-connect-hosts which should be set
to a list, containing strings of "host:port". You can then set
breakpoints in any of the files in any of the debuggee.

** Supports switching active thread
Clicking on a thread in the frames display makes that thread active
for future commands like step and resume.

** Menu of commands
A menu of the commonly used commands has been added.

* 0.2 (2009-05-07)

** Supports relative paths in jde-source-paths
Thanks to Len Trigg <len@netvalue.net.nz>

** Class that contains attributes pointing back to itself
If an attribute in a class contain a reference to itself, now the node
will just display as "this" and it will not be expandable, this is to
prevent confusion to the user because the attribute will be infinitely
expandable.

** Class loaded by multiple class loaders
Previously, if a class is loaded by that once by different class
loaders, setting breakpoint on the class might not work
properly. Fixed it.

** Invoking methods
When an object is expanded, there will be a pseudo node named
"methods" at the end of the list. Expanding the node will invoke the
method on the object. Only methods which do not need arguments can be
invoked.

** Break on all methods within a class
Now you can break on all the methods a class by positioning the cursor
on the first line in the class (usually "^public class...") and
calling jdibug-toggle-breakpoint or C-c C-c C-b. Multiple breakpoints
will be installed for the first line of every method in the
class. Note that the pseudo method <init> will also be breakpoint-ed.

** Setting breakpoint before debuggee is connected
You can now set the breakpoints before connecting to the debuggee.

** Fixed bug where expanding HttpServletRequest causes JBOSS to crash
As reported by Lei Wang <tendant@gmail.com>, when expanding
HttpServletRequest under JBOSS, it causes JBOSS to crash, the reason
being that there are several toString methods within the Integer
object, and we were invoking the wrong one. The fix makes sure we only
invoke those methods that takes no argument and returns a string.
