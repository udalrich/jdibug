<h2 class="chapter">1 Rationale</h2>

<p>One word, locals browser. As I started using JDEE, there are two
debuggers that are available, which are jdb and jdebug.

   <p>jdb is too simple to be used as a debugger, I find myself doing
<code>locals</code> repeatedly while stepping through the codes, and the
output of <code>locals</code> are not sorted! It is worse when I want to
inspect the attributes of particular objects.

   <p>jdebug is too slow and buggy for my liking, stepping through the
source files takes forever.

   <p>I then started using jswat, which is very user friendly. But it
doesn't integrate with Emacs.

   <p>So I created JDIbug.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Installation</h2>

<p>JDIbug is hosted at googlecode, at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jdibug/">http://code.google.com/p/jdibug/</a>

   <p>Download distribution file and untar it into somewhere within
your <code>load-path</code>. For example, I keep all my emacs modules under
my <samp><span class="file">~/emacs/site</span></samp>, so the jdibug <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> files will go into
<samp><span class="file">~/emacs/site/jdibug-0.4</span></samp>.

   <p>Then add the path into your <code>load-path</code>, and <code>require</code> it,
for example, I have the following in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/jdibug-0.5"))
     (require 'jdibug)
</pre>
   <p>You also need to install CEDET from
<a href="http://cedet.sourceforge.net/">http://cedet.sourceforge.net/</a>.  The current code was tested
with the 1.0pre7 release.  If you are using Emacs 23, CEDET should
already be installed as part of the release.  Otherwise, follow the
installation instructions from the above link.

   <p>That's it, you are good to go.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Configuration</h2>

<p>Although JDIbug current does not rely on any data from JDEE, a lot of
things are made very simple when using JDIbug with JDEE. So please
<a href="http://jdee.sourceforge.net/install.html">install JDEE</a> if you have not yet done it.

   <p>There are only two parameters that you need to configure before you
can start using JDIbug, which is the `jdibug-connect-hosts' parameter. 
<code>jdibug-connect-hosts</code> specifies a list of hostname and ports of
the debuggee process that you want to debug.  It is possible to
connect to multiple hosts.  For example, <code>("localhost:6001"
"server:6002")</code> would cause JDIbug to attempt to connect to a process
at port 6001 on the computer starting JDIbug and to port 6002 on the
machine &ldquo;server&rdquo;.

   <p>If you have multiple projects set up using JDEE's <samp><span class="file">prj.el</span></samp> file,
you can set the two parameters inside the <samp><span class="file">prj.el</span></samp> file so that
different projects can be connected using different host/ports by
JDIbug.

   <p>If you are using JDEE, you will also want to customize jde-run-option-debug, as shown below.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="images/jde-run-option-debug.png" alt="images/jde-run-option-debug.png"></div>

   <p>Ensure that you use the same port number when customizing `jdibug-connect-hosts' and `jde-run-option-debug'.

   <p>If you want to use JDIbug without using JDEE, you need to customize two
additional parameters.  Customize <code>jdibug-use-jde-source-paths</code> to false
(nil).  Then customize <code>jdibug-source-paths</code> to the location of your
source.  This should be a list of locations: <code>("~/src")</code>
<strong>not</strong> <code>"~/src"</code>.

   <p>If you are not using JDEE, you will want to add the following lines
the your java command.  (These values work with the Sun JVM.  Other
JVM's may need different parameters.)
<pre class="example">     -Xdebug
     -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=6001,server=y,suspend=y
</pre>

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Connecting</h2>

<p>After configuring JDIbug, use the key sequence <kbd>C-c C-c C-c</kbd> in a
jde-mode buffer to connect to the debuggee process. By default, the
frame will be split into windows each displaying different
buffers with the java source file on the top left, the locals browser
on the top right, the stack browser on the bottom left, and the
breakpoints list on the bottom right.

   <p>To disconnect from the debuggee, use the key sequence <kbd>C-c C-c
C-d</kbd>.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Breakpoints</h2>

<p>You can set breakpoints before or after you have made the connection
to the debuggee.

   <p>To toggle the breakpoint on the current line of java source, use the
key sequence <kbd>C-c C-c C-b</kbd> in the java source buffer. This toggles
the breakpoints on the current line between disabled, enabled, and no
breakpoint. The &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; status is just an easy way of remembering
that line as a line of interest but you do not want the debugger to
stop there.

   <p>If the line of code is not loaded when the breakpoint is requested, it
will be marked as pending. When the class is finally loaded, the
breakpoint will be installed.

   <p>You can also break on all the methods a class by positioning the
cursor on the first line in the class (usually <code>^public class</code>)
and calling <code>jdibug-toggle-breakpoint</code> or <kbd>C-c C-c
C-b</kbd>. Multiple breakpoints will be installed for the first line of
every method in the class. Note that the pseudo method <code>&lt;init&gt;</code>
will also be breakpoint-ed.

   <p>Attempting to set a breakpoint at a method declaration will not have
an effect (unless that line also contains executable code).

   <p><em>New in 0.4</em>  Previous versions did not support breakpoints in
inner classes.  Version 0.4 should support this functionality. 
Version 0.5 fixed bugs where these breakpoints were not always set.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Exception Breakpoints</h3>

<p><em>New in 0.5</em>  It is now possible to set a breakpoint for when an
exception is thrown. <code>jdibug-break-on-exception</code> will prompt for
the qualified name of a class.  When an exception of that class is
about to be thrown, the thread will be suspended.

   <p><code>jdibug-break-on-exception</code> will also ask if it should break for
caught or uncaught exceptions.  Due to interactions with native
methods and compiler-generated code, it is possible for a caught
exception to be reported as uncaught and vice versa.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">6 Stepping</h2>

<p>When the debugger is suspended, you can use the following key
sequences to step through the program.

<pre class="example">     C-c C-c C-n to step over.
     C-c C-c C-i to step into.
     C-c C-c C-o to step out.
</pre>
   <p>As these keys are used very often, I bind them to function keys for
faster access. I have the following in my .emacs file:

<pre class="example">     (define-key jde-mode-map [f8]   'jdibug-step-over)
     (define-key jde-mode-map [M-f8] 'jdibug-step-into)
     (define-key jde-mode-map [f7]   'jdibug-step-out)
     (define-key jde-mode-map [M-f7] 'jdibug-resume)
</pre>
   <p>When you are done, you can use the key sequence <kbd>C-c C-c C-r</kbd> to
resume the main thread in the debugger process. Or if you have added
the snipplet above, you can just <kbd>M-f7</kbd> for that.  You can also
use <kbd>C-c C-c C-a</kbd> to resume all threads in the JVM.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Locals Browser</h2>

<p>The locals browser uses the emacs tree-mode to display the local
variables. Each of the variables can be expanded to view the member
variables by clicking on the expand icon.

   <p>When the cursor is over any element in the tree, you can press the
<kbd>s</kbd> key to invoke the <code>toString</code> method on the variable under
the cursor. The result will be printed in the echo-area. You can also
press the <kbd>c</kbd> key to print the class name of the object under the
cursor in the echo area.

   <p>One extra feature that is very useful in the Locals Browser is that it
reduces the number of clicks that you have to do to inspect a
variable. By default, a number of java objects will be displayed with
their string representation, for example Boolean, Number, StringBuffer
etc. For decendants of Collection and Map, there will be extra
information displayed about the number of items that are within the
Collection of Map.

   <p>If you like the above feature, there's more! You can define custom
displayer functions for your own java objects, for example, if you
have a class <code>com.foo.Dog</code> which have a getter called
<code>getName</code>, and you want to see the name of the dog displayed, you
can just add the following line into your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> (after the
<code>(require 'jdibug)</code> line) and viola, you will see the name of the
dog instead of the <code>Dog</code> class name. The method that is specified
must receive no arguments and return a <code>java.lang.String</code>.

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'jdi-value-custom-set-strings '("com.foo.Dog" "getName"))
</pre>
   <p>When expanding a Collection or Map, the locals browser will be
displaying the contents as an array instead of having you to click one
or two more times to see the contents within the Collection or Map.

   <p>At the end of every object, there is a pseudo node named <code>methods</code>
that can be expanded to show all the methods for that object and also
static methods of the object's class. Expanding any of the methods
will invoke the method and the results of the invocation will be shown
in the expanded node. Currently only methods which does not need
arguments can be invoked.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Frames Browser</h2>

<p>The frames buffer is a simple list of all the frames from the
<code>main</code> up to the current function. It provides a simple
caller/callee stack of the current breakpoint. If the frame points to
a location which can be corresponded to a line of code in the source
path, the frame will be clickable, and the source code buffer will be
updated to show the file and line number. The locals browser will also
be updated to show the locals of that particular frame.

   <p>Please note that the current execution point does not change when you
switch between the frames, so if you do <code>jdibug-step-over</code>, the
stepping will go back to the original execution point.

   <p>Threads are also clickable.  This does not update the locals browser,
but does change which thread will be affected with subsequent commands
like <code>jdibug-resume</code> or <code>jdibug-step-into</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Breakpoints Browser</h2>

<p>The breakpoints buffer shows a list of the current active and disabled
breakpoints. Clicking on the breakpoints will show the line of code of
the breakpoint in the source code buffer.

</div>

<h3 class="section">9.1 Conditional Breakpoints</h3>

<p>Pressing <kbd>c</kbd> while at a breakpoint allows you to set a condition expression
on the breakpoint.  This feature is under development, so most common
expressions are understood and supported, but more complex constructs
might not work.  Whenever the breakpoint is reached, the expression is
evaluated. If the result is the boolean value true, execution stops as
usual for a breakpoint.  Otherwise, the program resumes execution.

   <p>Evaluating the expression is a fairly slow process, so conditional
breakpoints should be used with care.  Stopping on the fifth iteration
of a loop should not have a noticeable effect on the runtime, but
stopping on iteration 10,000 will take a long time.

   <p>The only error checking done at the time the condition is created is
to check that the expression is syntactically valid.  No attempt is
made to determine that the result is a boolean or that any variables
referenced in the expression are in scope.  If the expression is
invalid, the program will resume execution.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Threads Browser</h2>

<p>The threads buffer is normally not visible, but can be shown by the
command <code>jdibug-debug-view-1</code>.  This buffer lists all of the
threads and threadgroups in the JVM (including system threads that are
suppressed in the frames browser).

   <p>When expanding a thread, details about the thread are shown as well as
buttons to suspend and resume the thread.  Suspending the thread can
be useful to determine where it is executing, as it allows it to be
selected as the current thread in the frames browser.  At that point,
it is possible to step through the thread with the usual commands.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Watchpoint Buffer</h2>

<p><em>New in 0.4</em> The watchpoint buffer can be shown by <code>jdibug-debug-view-2</code> if it
is not initially visible.  This buffer displays a list of
expressions.  Whenever the current thread is suspended, the
expressions are also evaluated.

   <p>If there is an error in the expression (a variable is out of scope,
a name is mispelled, the expression contains unsupported operations)
an error message is displayed instead.

   <p>The expressions that are supported by conditional breakpoints are
exactly those that are supposed by watchpoints, so you can test if
your expression will work in a conditional breakpoint by first
entering it as a watchpoint.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Window Layout</h2>

<p>The default four buffers layout is what I like the most on my screen. 
The commands <code>jdibug-debug-view</code>, <code>jdibug-debug-view-1</code> and
<code>jdibug-debug-view-2</code> display different windows.  If you do not
like any of these, creating additional commands can be done fairly
simply by modifying those commands.

   <p>After you create your own functions that create the window layout of
your liking, and then add this in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     (remove-hook 'jdibug-connected-hook 'my-jdibug-debug-view)
     (remove-hook 'jdibug-detached-hook  'my-jdibug-undebug-view)
</pre>
   <p>And then proceed to add your equivalent functions in the above
hooks. You can refer to the two functions <code>jdibug-debug-view</code> and
<code>jdibug-undebug-view</code> for a start.
