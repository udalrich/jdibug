** Invoking methods
When an object is expanded, there will be a pseudo node named
"methods" at the end of the list. Expanding the node will invoke the
method on the object. Only methods which do not need arguments can be
invoked.

** Break on all methods within a class
Now you can break on all the methods a class by positioning the cursor
on the first line in the class (usually "^public class...") and
calling jdibug-toggle-breakpoint or C-c C-c C-b. Multiple breakpoints
will be installed for the first line of every method in the
class. Note that the pseudo method <init> will also be breakpoint-ed.

** Setting breakpoint before debuggee is connected
You can now set the breakpoints before connecting to the debuggee.
