** Break on all methods within a class
Now you can break on all the methods a class by positioning the cursor
on the first line in the class (usually "^public class...") at calling
jdibug-toggle-breakpoint or C-c C-c C-b. Multiple breakpoints will be
installed for the first line of every method in the class. Note that
the pseudo method <init> will also be breakpoint-ed.
