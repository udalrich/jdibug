* 0.2 (in development)

** Class loaded by multiple class loaders
Previously, if a class is loaded by that once by different class
loaders, setting breakpoint on the class might not work
properly. Fixed it.

** Invoking methods
When an object is expanded, there will be a pseudo node named
"methods" at the end of the list. Expanding the node will invoke the
method on the object. Only methods which do not need arguments can be
invoked.

** Break on all methods within a class
Now you can break on all the methods a class by positioning the cursor
on the first line in the class (usually "^public class...") and
calling jdibug-toggle-breakpoint or C-c C-c C-b. Multiple breakpoints
will be installed for the first line of every method in the
class. Note that the pseudo method <init> will also be breakpoint-ed.

** Setting breakpoint before debuggee is connected
You can now set the breakpoints before connecting to the debuggee.

** Fixed bug where expanding HttpServletRequest causes JBOSS to crash
As reported by Lei Wang <tendant@gmail.com>, when expanding
HttpServletRequest under JBOSS, it causes JBOSS to crash, the reason
being that there are several toString methods within the Integer
object, and we were invoking the wrong one. The fix makes sure we only
invoke those methods that takes no argument and returns a string.
