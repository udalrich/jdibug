;;; Commentary:

;; I can't code without a logging module. This code closely mimics log4j.

;; To use the logger inside your foo module, do this
;; (elog-make-logger foo)
;; you will then have access to the following functions:
;;
;;     foo-trace, foo-debug, foo-info, foo-warn, foo-error and foo-fatal
;;
;; its up to you to make sure they do not clash with any functions in
;; your module each of the above functions have the same signature as
;; the 'message' function.  Note that `message' is actually a bad
;; function to use here, since the first argument might have percent
;; signs in it.  elog-safe-message is a better alternative.

;; To configure what log goes where, create another file (I call this elog-conf.el)
;; and load it from your .emacs file after you require elog.el, this is totally
;; unneccessary if you do not wish to see any debugging output.
;; call the elog-set-appenders function, like this:
;;
;; (elog-set-appenders
;;  (list
;;   (make-elog-appender :category 'foo
;; 					     :priority 'trace
;; 					     :layout "%H:%M:%S [%p] %c : %m%n"
;; 					     :output " foo-log")
;;   (make-elog-appender :category 'bar
;; 					     :priority 'error
;; 					     :layout "%H:%M:%S [%p] %c : %m%n"
;; 					     :output " bar-log")
;;   (make-elog-appender :priority 'error
;; 					     :layout "%H:%M:%S [%p] %c : %m%n"
;; 					     :output 'elog-safe-message)))
;;
;; :category specifies the module that you pass to elog-make-logger
;; :priority specifies that anything above and including this priority
;;           will be logged
;; :layout   limited mimic of the Layout of log4j, current supported layout
;;               specifies:
;;                 %H = hour
;;                 %M = minute
;;                 %S = second
;;                 %c = category
;;                 %p = priority
;;                 %m = log message
;;                 %n = platform newline
;; :output   can either be a string or a function
;;           if its a string, its the name of the buffer that will be created
;;               and output to.
;;           if its a function, it must conform to the same signature as
;;               the message function.
;;
;; The above sample, will log everything from the foo module into the foo-log
;; buffer, all errors from bar module into bar-log buffer, and errors from
;; all modules will be message-d.

;; All the logging functions foo-* are macros, so they will not be evaluating
;; their arguments if logging is not enabled for that category and priority.
;; so it's safe to do something like this
;; (foo-debug "dump=%s" (convert-a-very-long-string-to-hex-format packet))

;; If anyhow you wish to check that whether logging is enabled for a certain
;; category and priority, you can use the following variables
;;
;; foo-trace-flag, foo-debug-flag, foo-info-flag, foo-warn-flag, foo-error-flag, and foo-fatal-flag
;;
;; they will have a value of t if logging is enabled for that priority.
;; This can be used for something like this
;; (if foo-trace-flag
;;     (dolist (packet packets)
;;        (foo-trace "packet:%s" packet)))

;; Good Luck Have Fun
