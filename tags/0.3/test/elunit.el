;;; Commentary:

;; Inspired by regress.el by Wayne Mesard and Tom Breton, Test::Unit
;; by Nathaniel Talbott, and xUnit by Kent Beck

;; ElUnit exists to accomodate test-driven development of Emacs Lisp
;; programs.  Tests are divided up into suites.  Each test makes a
;; number of assertions to ensure that things are going according to
;; expected.

;; Tests are divided into suites for the purpose of hierarchical
;; structure and hooks.  The hierarchy allows suites to belong to
;; suites, in essence creating test trees.  The hooks are meant to
;; allow for extra setup that happens once per test, for both before
;; and after it runs.

;; You may use Emacs' built-in `assert' function for checking such
;; things, but the assertions at the bottom of this file provide much
;; better reporting if you use them.  Using `assert-that' is preferred
;; over built-in `assert'.

;;; Usage:

;; See http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ElUnit for discussion and usage.
;; The file `elunit-test.el' contains meta-tests that you may find helpful
;; to refer to as samples.

;; Add the lines:
;; (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook)
;;           (lambda () (elunit "meta-suite")))
;; to the file containing your tests for convenient auto-running.

;; Unit tests are meant to test single low-level functions. If you
;; find yourself wanting to write higher-level tests, you may find
;; mode-unit.el (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ModeUnit)
;; useful as it is designed to help test whole Emacs modes.

;; TODO:

;; - improve readability of failure reports
;; - next-problem
